## Number Guessing Game 

A simple Python command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player has **8 attempts** to guess it.

### 🔹 How it Works:
- The game gives feedback: **"too low"**, **"too high"**, or **"correct"**.
- After 8 incorrect guesses, the game ends and reveals the correct number.
- It uses Python’s built-in `random` and handles invalid inputs with `try-except`.

### 🛠️ Tech Used:
- Python standard library (`random`)
- Terminal-based input/output
- Beginner-friendly logic with loops and conditionals
